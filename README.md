# Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains the **Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Algorithms** implemented in a simplified format

## Overview:

### Supervised Deep Learning Projects:
**1. Artificial Neural Network Simplified (Churn Dataset)**

Goals of the project -
* To understand the basic implemetation of the ANN
* To build the ANN layer by layer and understanding the significance of each layer and the arguments used
* To know more open the folder **Supervised Models**

**2. Convolutional Neural Network Simplified (Classification of Dog/Cat)**

Goals of the project -
* Performing operations like Convolutional, MaxPooling, Flatten, etc
* Using Image Data Generator for Pre-processing 
* To know more open the folder **Supervised Models** 

**3. Recurrent Neural Network Simplified (Google Stock Price Forecasting)**

Goals of the project -
* To understand the concept of time steps
* Creating training and testing set from the same data by using the concept of time steps
* Understanding the significance of RNN in terms of forecasting and its limitations

### Unsupervised Deep Learning Projects:
**1. Credit Card Fraud Detection using Self-Organzied Map**

**Objective :**
* Suppose we are Deep Learning Scientists working at a bank and we are given a datatset regarding th customers of this bank who are applying for an advanced Credit Card
* This data would be info that a customer provies while applying for the card
* And our job is to detect potential frauds among these applications
* In the end we should be able to give a list to the Manager of the customers who cheated on their application

**Approach :**
* Unlike the Machine Learning Models, where we predict whether each customer might be a potential fradulent by already training our machine based on previously labelled fraudster as YES or NO, here our approach would be to not consider the dependent variable and plot a map which shows us what a fraudster would look like
* We will use an Unsupervised Deep Learning Algorithm called Self-Organzing Map, which means we will be identifying patterns in high dimensional datasets full of non linear * relationships and one of these patterns(in this case the customers) will be the potential frauds or the customers who cheated
* In more simple terms I will be doing Customer Segmentation to identify segments of customers and one of the segments will contain the customers who cheated

**Goals of this project :**
Understanding the idealogy of Self Organizing Map
Implementing concepts like - Winning Node, Dimensionality Reduction, Mean Inter-neuron Distance
