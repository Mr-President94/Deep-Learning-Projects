# Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains the Deep Learning Algorithms implemented in a simplified format

### **1. Artificial Neural Network Simplified (Churn Dataset)**
**Goals of the project -**
* To understand the basic implemetation of the ANN
* To build the ANN layer by layer and understanding the significance of each layer and the arguments used
* To understand how to cross validate the results of ANN
* Learn to fine tune the ANN using Grid Search Mechanism

### **2. Convolutional Neural Netowrk Simplified (Classification of Dog/Cat)**
**Goals of the project -**
* To understand the basic implemetation of the CNN
* To build the CNN layer by layer and understanding the significance of each layer and the arguments used
* Performing operations like Convolutional, MaxPooling, Flatten, etc
* Undeestanding the concepts of vector in Flattening and Full Connection
