# Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains the **Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Algorithms** implemented in a simplified format

## Overview:

#### Supervised Deep Learning Projects:
**1. Artificial Neural Network Simplified (Churn Dataset)**
Goals of the project -
* To understand the basic implemetation of the ANN
* To build the ANN layer by layer and understanding the significance of each layer and the arguments used
* To know more open the folder **Supervised Models**

**2. Convolutional Neural Network Simplified (Classification of Dog/Cat)**
Goals of the project -
* Performing operations like Convolutional, MaxPooling, Flatten, etc
* Using Image Data Generator for Pre-processing 
* To know more open the folder **Supervised Models** 

**3. Recurrent Neural Network Simplified (Google Stock Price Forecasting)**
Goals of the project -
* To understand the concept of time steps
* Creating training and testing set from the same data by using the concept of time steps
* Understanding the significance of RNN in terms of forecasting and its limitations
