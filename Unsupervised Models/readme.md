## 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection using Self-Organzied Map

### Objective :
* Suppose we are Deep Learning Scientists working at a bank and we are given a datatset regarding th customers of this bank who are applying for an advanced Credit Card
* This data would be info that a customer provies while applying for the card
* And our job is to detect potential frauds among these applications
* In the end we should be able to give a list to the Manager of the customers who cheated on their application

### Goals of this project  
* Unlike the Machine Learning Models, where we predict whether each customer might be a potential fradulent by already training our machine based on previously labelled fraudster as YES or NO, here our approach would be to not consider the dependent variable and plot a map which shows us what a fraudster would look like
* We will use an **Unsupervised Deep Learning Algorithm** called **Self-Organzing Map**, which means we will be identifying patterns in high dimensional datasets full of non linear relationships and one of these patterns(in this case the customers) will be the potential frauds or the customers who cheated
* In more simple terms I will be doing Customer Segmentation to identify segments of customers and one of the segments will contain the customers who cheated

**Some other goals inculde -** 
* Understanding the idealogy of Self Organizing Map
* Implementing concepts like - Winning Node, Dimensionality Reduction, Mean Inter-neuron Distance 
* Interpreting outliers in the SOM 
* nderstanding the need of Normalization
* Interpreting the SOM in detail and making it more interactive by mapping the info from the dataset
* Inverse mapping, inverse scaling and getting the list of potential fraudsters
